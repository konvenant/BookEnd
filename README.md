## README for Book Management API

**Project:** Book Management API

**Description:**

This Node.js API provides functionalities for managing a collection of books in a database. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete books, including handling book covers as images (optional).

**Features:**

- **Create Book:** Add a new book to the database with title, author, ISBN, published date, and cover image (optional).
- **Update Book Cover:** Update the existing cover image for a specific book.

- **Get Book by ID:** Fetch a specific book using its unique identifier.
- **Update Book by ID:** Modify details of a book identified by its ID.
- **Delete Book by ID:** Remove a book permanently from the database.

**Requirements:**

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Express.js
- Mongoose (or another ODM for MongoDB)
- A database solution (e.g., MongoDB)
- (Optional) Middleware for image upload/processing (e.g., Multer)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)

**Usage:**

1. Start the server using `node index.js` (or your preferred script).
2. Use a REST client like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.

**API Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Success Status | Error Status |

| `/api/books/:id` | DELETE | Delete a book | 200 OK | 404 Not Found (book not found) |

**Error Handling:**

The API returns JSON responses with status codes and messages to indicate success or failure of a request. 

* Success: 200 OK, 201 Created
* Client Errors: 400 Bad Request (missing fields, invalid data)
* Server Errors: 500 Internal Server Error (unexpected error)
* Not Found: 404 Not Found (book not found)

**Note:**

- Replace `:id` in the endpoints with the actual book ID you want to access.

## Testing Instructions

This API utilizes Jest for unit testing. To run the tests:

1. Make sure you have Jest installed globally: `npm install -g jest`
2. From the project directory, run: `npm test`

These tests cover various functionalities of the API, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting books. 

**Additional Notes:**

- The tests connect to a separate test database defined in the `beforeAll` function.
- The database is cleared after each test to ensure isolation.
- The tests showcase examples of using `supertest` for making API requests.

By following these instructions, you can effectively test and verify the functionality of the Book Management API.
